# Observability with Grafana

Use the scripts in this folder to install and start Grafana. After you have started Grafana, make sure you import the dashboard definitions from the [Dapr release](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/releases) you are running. You need the following files:

- grafana-actor-dashboard.json
- grafana-sidecar-dashboard.json
- grafana-system-services-dashboard.json

(You need to click the 'Show all assets' link below the assets list.)
